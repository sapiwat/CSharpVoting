# C# Console Voting Application

A fundamental **C# Console Application** designed to practice core programming logic, user input handling, and conditional data processing. This project serves as a practical exercise in my journey to master modern **.NET development**.

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes & Skills

By developing this tool, I focused on the following C# fundamentals:

- **Input Validation:** Managing user input to ensure data integrity (e.g., handling numerical age inputs).
- **Conditional Logic:** Implementing business rules to determine voting eligibility and processing results based on specific criteria.
- **Data Types & Variables:** Effective use of C# primitive types and control structures to manage application state.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Organizing logic into a readable and maintainable console interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 8 / .NET Core
- **Application Type:** Console Application

## 📝 Project Motivation

This project is part of my intensive review of **C# language specifications**. While simple in functionality, it reinforces the essential logic required for building complex enterprise systems. At **TechnologyOne**, where C# is a core technology, I believe having a rock-solid grasp of these fundamentals is the first step toward building scalable and reliable software.
